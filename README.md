# Trade Slippage Arin Dhawan 

The repo contains Task1 (feature engineering) and Task2 (Slippage Calculations). I have also added the given and new papers within the Slippage papers. I have also included formulas from the new papers. 

Links for the new papers:

* [Trading Costs by Andrea Frazzini, et al](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3229719)
* [The Slippage Paradox by Steffen Bohn](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1103.2214#:~:text=The%20slippage%2C%20usually%20seen%20as,is%20the%20cost%20of%20waiting%20.)
